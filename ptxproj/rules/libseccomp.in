	  An Enhanced Seccomp (mode 2) Helper Library

	  The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent, interface
	  to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism.  The libseccomp API is
	  designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall filter language and
	  present a more conventional function-call based filtering interface that should
	  be familiar to, and easily adopted by, application developers.

	  Install some utils, useful for development.
	  Note: in order to run some of these utils the tools 'uniq', 'sort',
	  'expr' and 'mktemp' from the 'Busybox' *or* 'Coreutils' package is
	  required.
