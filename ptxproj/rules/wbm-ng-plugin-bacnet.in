#   This file contains the main config tools target needed by ptxdist to
#   process ${__THIS_FILENAME__}.make as well as the common configuration
#   entries for the config tools meta package: the feature entries, the config
#   file entries and the config tool entries.  
#
#   The feature targets are visible in the ptxdist menu. They are used to
#   enable or disable menu entries in all frontends (i.e. eth1 settings may be
#   disabled if the feature "Ethernet Switch" is active).

# This is the target corresponding to ${__THIS_FILENAME__}.make
