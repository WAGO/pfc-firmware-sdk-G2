	  The GNU Bourne Again SHell
	  Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
 	  commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
 	  incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

	  Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
 	  IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

	  Included in the bash package is the Programmable Completion Code,
	  by Ian Macdonald.

config BASH_SHLIKE
	bool
	prompt "Enable minimal sh like configuration"
	help
	  This produces a shell with minimal features, close to the
	  historical Bourne shell.

config BASH_ALIASES
	bool
	prompt "Enable aliases"
	default y
	help
	  Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word
	  when it is used as the first word of a simple command.
	  The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be
	  set  and unset with the alias and unalias builtin commands

config BASH_ARITHMETIC_FOR
	bool
	prompt "Enable arithmetic for command"
	help
	  Include support for the alternate form of the for command that
	  behaves like the C language for statement.
	  This does not work properly in bash-2.05b!

config BASH_ARRAY
	bool
	prompt "Include shell array variables"
	default y

config BASH_HISTORY
	bool
	prompt "Turn on csh-style history substitution"
	default y
	help
	  The bash shell supports a history expansion feature
	  that is similar to the history expansion in csh.

config BASH_BRACE
	bool
	prompt "Include brace expansion"
	default y
	help
	  Brace  expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary
	  strings may be generated.  This mechanism is similar
	  to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated
	  need not exist.

config BASH_CASEMODATTR
	bool
	prompt "include case-modifying variable attributes"

config BASH_CASEMODEXP
	bool
	prompt "include case-modifying word expansions"

	prompt "enable support for bash debugger"

config BASH_DIREXPDEFLT
	bool
	prompt "enable the direxpand shell option by default"

config BASH_DIRSTACK
	bool
	prompt "Enable builtins pushd/popd/dirs"
	default y
	help
	   Without  options, "dirs" displays the list of
	   currently remembered directories.  The default
	   display is on a single line with directory
	   names separated by spaces.  Directories are
	   added to the list with the pushd command;
	   the popd command removes entries from the list.

config BASH_DISABLED_BUILDINS
	bool
	prompt "Allow disabled builtins to still be invoked"

config BASH_DPARAN_ARITH
	bool

config BASH_GLOB_ASCIIRANGE_DEFLT
	bool
	prompt "bracket range pattern matching uses C locale"
	help
	  force bracket range expressions in pattern matching to use the C
	  locale by default

config BASH_HELP
	bool
	prompt "Include the help builtin"
	help
	  This builtin supports minimal help features inside bash

config BASH_CMDHISTORY
	bool
	prompt "Turn on command history"
	default y
	help
	  This enables command history features. The shell
	  buffers commands in a ringbuffer, which can be listed,
	  searched and accessed by various commands and magic
	  shell expansion features.

config BASH_JOBS
	bool
	prompt "Enable job control features"
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for background jobs in bash.
	  You can list the actual managed jobs by the "jobs" command.

config BASH_MULTIBYTE
	bool
	prompt "Enable multibyte characters"
	default y
	help
	  Enable multibyte characters if OS supports them.

config BASH_PROCSUBST
	bool
	prompt "Enable process substitution"
	default y
	help
	  This enables process substitution if the operating system
	  provides the necessary support.
	  Process substitution is supported on systems that support
	  named pipes (FIFOs) or the '/dev/fd' method of naming open
	  files. It takes the form of <(list) or >(list).

config BASH_BASHCOMPLETION
	bool
	prompt "Enable programmable completion"
	help
	  Enable the programmable completion facilities.
	  When word completion is attempted for an argument to a
	  command for which a completion specification (a compspec) has
	  been defined using the complete builtin, the programmable
	  completion facilities are invoked.
	  If Readline is not enabled, this option has no effect.

config BASH_ESC
	bool
	prompt "Turn on escape character decoding in prompts"
	default y
	help
	  Turn on the interpretation of a number of backslash-escaped
	  characters in the $PS1, $PS2, $PS3, and $PS4 prompt strings.

config BASH_EDIT
	bool
#	prompt "Turn on command line editing"
	default y
	help
	  Include support for command-line editing and history with
	  the Bash version of the Readline library.

config BASH_RESTRICTED
	bool
	prompt "Enable a restricted shell"
	help
	  Include support for a restricted shell. If this is enabled,
	  Bash enters a restricted mode, when called as rbash or invoked
	  with the `--restricted' or `-r' option.
	  A restricted shell is used to set up an environment
	  more controlled than the standard shell.

config BASH_SELECT
	bool
	prompt "Include select command"
	help
	  Include the select builtin, which allows the generation of
	  simple menus.

config BASH_SEP_HELPFILES
	bool
	depends on BROKEN
	prompt "use external files for help builtin documentation"

config BASH_SINGLE_HELPLINE
	bool
	prompt "store help documentation as a single string to ease translation"

endif

config BASH_GPROF
	bool
	prompt "Allow profiling with gprof"
	help
	  This builds a Bash binary that produces profiling information
	  to be processed by gprof each time it is executed.

config BASH_STATIC
	bool
	prompt "Link bash statically"
	help
	  This causes Bash to be linked statically, if gcc is being used.
	  This could be used to build a version to use as root's shell.

config BASH_CURSES
	bool
	prompt "Use libcurses instead of libtermcap"

endif
