         Ethernet bridge frame table administration
         Ebtables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of
         Ethernet frame rules in the Linux kernel. It is analogous to iptables,
         but operates at the MAC layer rather than the IP layer.

       select EBTABLES_INSTALL_TOOLS
       help
         The ebtables-restore command is used to restore
         the ebtables rule-set that was saved with the
         ebtables-save command.

       bool "install ebtables-save"

       select EBTABLES_INSTALL_TOOLS
       help
         The ebtables-save command is a (perl-)tool to
         save the current rule-set into a file that
         ebtables-restore can use.
