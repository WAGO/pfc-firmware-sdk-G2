	  Test programs for rt kernels

	  rt-tests contains a set of programs that test and measure
	  various components of "realtime" kernel behavior, such as
	  timer latency, signal latency and the functioning of
	  priority-inheritance mutexes.

	  Skip rt-tests targetinstall stage in order to save memory
	  inside the target device. The install stage will create the package
	  files into $(PTXDIST_PLATFORMDIR)/packages.

	  cyclictest is a benchmark program that can be used to find
	  worst case realtime latencies.

	bool

	help
	  Hackbench is both a benchmark and a stress test for the Linux
	  kernel scheduler. It's main job is to create a specified number
	  of pairs of schedulable entities (either threads or traditional
	  processes) which communicate via either sockets or pipes and time
	  how long it takes for each pair to send data back and forth.

	  This is the improved hackbench implementation, taken from (and
	  described inline in)
	  http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/hackbench.c

	  It uses a default of 100 loops, 10 groups and 20 FDs.
