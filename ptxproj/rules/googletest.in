	  Google Test is a unit testing library for the C++ programming 
	  language, based on the xUnit architecture. The library allows 
	  unit-testing of 'C' sources as well as C++ with minimal source 
	  modification. The tests themselves could be run one at a time, 
	  or even be called to run all at once. This makes the debugging 
	  process very specific and caters to the need of many programmers 
	  and coders alike.
