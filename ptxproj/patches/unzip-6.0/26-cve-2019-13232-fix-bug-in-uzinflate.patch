Subject: Fix bug in UZinflate() that incorrectly updated G.incnt.
Origin: https://github.com/madler/unzip/commit/5c572555cf5d80309a07c30cf7a54b2501493720
X-Debian-version: 6.0-26

    Fix bug in UZinflate() that incorrectly updated G.incnt.
    
    The update assumed a full buffer, which is not always full. This
    could result in a false overlapped element detection when a small
    deflate-compressed file was unzipped using an old zlib. This
    commit remedies that.
