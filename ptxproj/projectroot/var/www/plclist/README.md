#PLC List Generation

The PLC List generation generates the file `plclist.html` based upon data from the file `/etc/specific/plcselect.conf`. This file gets watched by inotify to trigger the generation of a new `plclist.html` file.
The PLC List HTML Structure is generated by the PHP Script `generate_plclist.php`.



##Scripts

The project depends on the scripts `init_filewatcher.sh` which is placed in `/etc/script`. This script starts the inotify watching of the the plclist.conf file. The startup script `/etc/init.d/filewatcher` offers the tasks start and stop to start up the inotify service.
