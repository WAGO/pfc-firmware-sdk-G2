/etc/config-tools/events/networking

CAUTION: When this folder is called from the netconfd service the service itself 
should not be called again from within this folder, as this would lead to call 
loops. In this case it is important to make sure that none of the directly called 
applications calls netconfd again, since this will also result in a loop.

When netconfd is calling executables of this folder all configurations about 
bridges, IPs and network interfaces are provided by netconfd as call parameters. 
That way any back-queries to netconfd are unnecessary. An example usage can be 
found in the executable update_config.
