NULLDEREF -- A module for playing with kernel NULL/invalid pointer dereferences

PTXDIST-INTEGRATION
PTXdist integration of project / package nullderef with a new PTXdist compatible
makefile was done by WAGO. To build the kernel module just activate nullderef as
module (M) in PTXdist menuconfig.

BUILDING FOR HOST SYSTEM
This module should build against any remotely recent 2.6 kernel. To
build, you'll need the kernel headers for your kernel installed. On
Debian or Ubuntu, try:
 # apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
on Fedora, try:
 # yum install kernel-devel

Once you've got those, just run 'make host' to produce a 'nullderef.ko'
file.

USING
nullderef uses debugfs to export its hooks. In order to you use it,
you'll need mount debugfs somewhere. /sys/kernel/debug is traditional,
so try (as root):

 # mount debugfs -t debugfs /sys/kernel/debug/

And then simply
 # insmod nullderef.ko

Once you're done crashing your kernel, if your machine is still
stable, you can remove the module using:
 # rmmod nullderef

You shuld now have a /sys/kernel/debug/nullderef/ directory,
containing two files, "null_read", and "null_call".

Writing to either of these files will result in a NULL pointer
dereference in the kernel. "null_read" will simply try to read a NULL
pointer. "null_call" will read a function pointer from the NULL
address, and then attempt to call through the resulting pointer.
